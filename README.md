# ToDo-List-App
A "To-Do List" App designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to organize and prioritize your tasks. Todo Lists are the lists that we generally use to maintain our day-to-day tasks or list of everything that we have to do, with the most important tasks at the top and the least important tasks at the bottom. It is helpful in planning our daily schedules. We can add more tasks at any time and delete a task that is completed.
